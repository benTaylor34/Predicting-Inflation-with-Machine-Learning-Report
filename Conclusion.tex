\chapter{Conclusion}
With inflation's large influence on society and the constant research conducted within machine learning; knowing which models are the most suitable for forecasting inflation and similar macroeconomic problems provides a compelling foundation for future research to compound upon.
This project provides such a foundation for future endeavors by proposing the use of feedforward neural networks and long short-term memory networks for complex time series forecasting whilst ruling out the use of simpler models such as linear regression, random forest regression, and support vector regression.
Through implementation and analysis, the positives and negatives of each model have been discussed.
%Thus meeting teh projects inital aims.

\section{Shortcomings and Future Improvements}
Throughout this project, numerous issues were faced and several improvements could have been made.
'Predicting Inflation with Machine Learning' required a strong foundational knowledge of machine learning that had to be built and developed from start to finish of the project.
This required lots of studying of the current literature and countless hours spent looking through documentation and community forums in order to ensure the implementations of each model were correct and of an acceptable standard.
As the project progressed this knowledge began to compound and tasks that would have been laborious at the start of the year became intuitive.
