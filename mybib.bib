abstract = {Financial time series (FTS) are nonlinear, dynamic and chaotic. The search for models to facilitate FTS forecasting has been highly pursued for decades. Despite major related challenges, there has been much interest in this topic, and many efforts to forecast financial market pricing and the average movement of various financial assets have been implemented. Researchers have applied different models based on computer science and economics to gain efficient information and earn money through financial market investment decisions. Machine learning (ML) methods are popular and successful algorithms applied in the FTS domain. This paper provides a timely review of ML’s adoption in FTS forecasting. The progress of FTS forecasting models using ML methods is systematically summarized by searching articles published from 2011 to 2021. Focusing on the analysis of ML methods applied to the theoretical basis and empirical application of FTS data forecasting, this paper provides a relevant reference for FTS forecasting and interdisciplinary fusion research against the background of computational intelligence and big data. The literature survey reveals that the most commonly used models for prediction involve long short-term memory (LSTM) and hybrid methods. The main contribution of this paper is not only building a systematic program to compare the merits and demerits of specific FTS forecasting models but also detecting the importance and differences of each model to help researchers and practitioners make good choices. In addition, the limitations to be addressed and future research directions of ML models’ adoption in FTS forecasting are identified.}

abstract = {High-dimensional data, where the number of features or covariates can even be larger than the number of independent samples, are ubiquitous and are encountered on a regular basis by statistical scientists both in academia and in industry. A majority of the classical research in statistics dealt with the settings where there is a small number of covariates. Due to the modern advancements in data storage and computational power, the high-dimensional data revolution has significantly occupied mainstream statistical research. In gene expression datasets, for instance, it is not uncommon to encounter datasets with observations on at most a few hundred independent samples (subjects) and with information on tens or hundreds of thousands of genes per each sample. An important and common question that arises quickly is—“which of the available covariates are relevant to the outcome of interest?” This concerns the problem of variable selection (and more generally model selection) in statistics and data science. This chapter will provide an overview of some of the most well-known model selection methods along with some of the more recent methods. While frequentist methods will be discussed, Bayesian approaches will be given a more elaborate treatment. The frequentist framework for model selection is primarily based on penalization, whereas the Bayesian framework relies on prior distributions for inducing shrinkage and sparsity. The chapter treats the Bayesian framework in the light of objective and empirical Bayesian viewpoints as the priors in the high-dimensional setting are typically not completely based subjective prior beliefs. An important practical aspect of high-dimensional model selection methods is computational scalability which will also be discussed.}

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is an attempt to reach a better stock valuation model of the Fundamental Analysis Approach, by reviewing the theoretical foundations and literature reviews. By reviewing the theoretical foundations for each model of the fundamental analysis models, and sequentially beginning of the Discounted Dividend Model (DDM), through a Multiplier Models, and finally the Discounted Cash Flow Model (DCFM), we find that all these models have strengths, despite the lack of accuracy, because it is required financial efficiency market. Recently Ohlson (1995) stated the simulated benefit in the formulation of the Residual Income Model (RIM). The Ohlson Model identifies the relationship between stock values and accounting variables. By reviewing the literature reviews, in financial markets, we conclude that the best model that can be relied upon to predict stock value, that proved credibility in both emerging and developed markets, is Residual Income Model (RIM), which doesn’t require financial efficiency for its application.}
