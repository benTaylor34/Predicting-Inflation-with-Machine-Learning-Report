\section{Tools}
\subsection{Coding Environemnt}
The IDE used for this project was Jupyter Notebook provided through the use of Anaconda.
Anaconda is a platform that includes a packet manager, this makes it easy to control packages and their dependencies that are installed in an environment.
Each environment in Anaconda is isolated which allows version control and preventing conflicts between the installed versions and packages of different projects.
This is valuable when working on multiple projects simultaneously.
Furthermore, Anaconda provides Jupyter Notebook integration which is beneficial as it is a common IDE for data science and has an active community making it easy to learn.
\subsection{Visualisation}
Jupyter Notebook provides visualisation as output from individual cells.
This was useful for debugging throughout the project.
Both Matplotlib and Seaborn were used for further graphical visualisation.
\subsection{libraries}

NumPy\cite{harris2020array} and Pandas\cite{reback2020pandas} - These libraries were used for data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy provides several tools for dealing with multidimensional arrays. 
Pandas is built upon NumPy and is used for dealing with tabular data (data that is organised into a table with rows and columns).
Pandas also has built-in tools for dealing with time-series data which is useful as inflation is time-series data.\\

TensorFlow\cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper} and Keras\cite{chollet2015keras} - TensorFlow is a platform developed by Google for training machine learning models.
It provides several functions and nodes that are useful when creating a neural network.
Using pre-written functions written by a reliable source both saves time and resources during development.
Keras is built on top of TensorFlow and aims to provide a simplified and more user-friendly interface for creating and training machine learning models.\\

SciKitLearn\cite{scikit-learn} - Sklearn is a machine learning library that provides a wide range of easy-to-implement machine learning models and metrics.
Its extensive documentation makes it easy to learn and implement.\\

Matplotlib\cite{Hunter:2007} and Seaborn\cite{Waskom2021} - Matplotlib and Seaborn were used for all graphical data visualisation.
These libraries provide a plethora of graphing options along with plenty of community support.
