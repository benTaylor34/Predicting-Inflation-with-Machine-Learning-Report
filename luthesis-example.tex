\chapter{Abstract}

\textbf{This document contains lots of useful information on how to
  use \textsf{luthesis} and \LaTeX\ in general to typeset your thesis.
  Please read it carefully.}

This is the abstract.  It could have been marked-up in an
\verb|abstract| environment, but then would not have appeared in the
Table of Contents (ToC).

\chapter{Acknowledgements}

This is the ACKs chapter.  It is quite hard to write!

Whilst we're here, it is important to point out that in your real
thesis, you should probably keep each chapter in a separate
\verb|.tex| file.  You bring these into your document using
\verb|\include{filename}| (without the \verb|.tex| extension).

I would like to acknowledge Mark Withall, John Whitley and Iain
Phillips for contributing code for and help with \textsf{luthesis}.

              % thesis.

\chapter{Introduction}

Here set out your main goals.  Make sure you define all of the terms
in your thesis title.

You may also find the following programs useful:
\textbf{lacheck}~\cite{lacheck} for detecting common errors in your
code and \textbf{latexmk} and \textbf{rubber}~\cite{rubber} for
automating the building of complex \LaTeX\ documents (note that this
doesn't currently work with \textsf{glossaries} sadly---feel free to
patch it to add the support!)

Don't forget to read the recommended introduction to
\LaTeX\footnote{\url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf}}.

You can use the \textsf{beamer} package~\cite{beamer} to typeset
presentations!

If you need help with \TeX, then consult the \TeX\
FAQ\footnote{\url{http://faq.tug.org}}.  There is also the newsgroup
\verb|comp.text.tex| and Loughborough's local mailing list,
``typo'' (send an email (with any subject) containing the
  words \texttt{subscribe typo} in the body to
  \url{majordomo@lists.lboro.ac.uk}).  Of course, we encourage active
discussion in the lab about \TeX, too!

If you need help using this \verb!luthesis! class, then subscribe to the
\verb!luthesis! mailing list following the instructions above.

\section{Which \TeX\ Distribution?}

If you are using Linux, you should install the \TeX Live packages
(which could be as simple as opening a terminal and typing
\verb|apt-get install texlive-latex| if you're using Debian or
Ubuntu).

For other systems visit \url{http://www.texlive.org} and download the
files specific to your operating system.

\emph{It is important to note that most, if not all, of the packages
  mentioned here should be included in your \TeX\ distribution
  already---including documentation.}

\section{Which Editor?}

There are many \TeX\ and \LaTeX\ editors available, ranging from the
classic text editors such as \textbf{vim} (of which there is a Mac
version\footnote{\url{http://code.google.com/p/macvim/}}) and emacs
(see Appendix) to dedicated ``\LaTeX\ IDE''s\footnote{e.g.\ Kile
  \url{http://kile.sourceforge.net/}} or more wordprocessor-like
programs\footnote{i.e.\ LyX \url{http://www.lyx.org/}}.

There will be an editor to suit your style of working!

\section{Which Bibliography Manager?}

This is a very important area!  The best one we've found is
BibDesk\footnote{\url{http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/}}.  However,
this is Mac-only, so you'll probably like to try either
KBibTeX\footnote{\url{http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~fischer/kbibtex/}}
if you are on Linux or
JabRef\footnote{\url{http://jabref.sourceforge.net/}} if you want a
cross-platform solution.

There are also some new web-entangled systems that look quite
interesting.  Of course there are bookmarking sites such as
\url{http://www.citeulike.com/} but there is also a system that lives
inside one's web browser, too.\footnote{Zotero
  \url{http://www.zotero.org/}}

Whatever tool you eventually settle on, make sure that it is both
efficient to use (i.e.\ getting citations in is quick and easy and
that you can find them and manage them, including their unique
identifiers, in a way that appeals to you) but also allows export to
the \textbf{bibtex} format of citations for use in \LaTeX\ (many
bibliography managers use \textbf{bibtex} files as their database, so
this is automatic).

\section{Installing \textsf{luthesis}}

Please read the comments in \texttt{luthesis.cls} for information on
how to install.  These comments also contain important usage
information.  As with most \LaTeX-related file formats, you can open
the class file with a text editor.


\chapter{Literature Review}

Here we discuss what others have done in the area.  Close with the gap
analysis and a brief description of what's next in your thesis.

The \textsf{gcite} package~\cite{gcite} can provide a more readable
way to present citations to your external examiner.


\chapter{Method}

Describe what you did and why.  If you need to use lots of
abbreviations or jargon in your thesis, then the \textsf{glossaries}
package~\cite{glossaries} should come in very handy!

If you are using a lot of maths in your work, you must check out the
AMS packages\footnote{\url{http://www.ams.org/tex/amslatex.html}}.
These contain a lot of extra symbols and environments that are useful
for typesetting maths.

Remember that it's important to make vector-based (as opposed to
bitmap) diagrams where possible.  This enables them to be printed at
any resolution and avoids problems such as pixelation that are common
with bitmaps.  You can use GUI programs such as
\textbf{Dia}\footnote{\url{http://live.gnome.org/Dia}},
\textbf{Inkscape}\footnote{\url{http://www.inkscape.org/}} and the
venerable \textbf{Xfig}\footnote{\url{http://www.xfig.org/}} to do
this or, if you're a real h4rdc0r3 1337 g33k you could use any number
of programmatic and often \TeX-friendly solutions such as
\textbf{METAPOST}\footnote{\url{http://www.tug.org/metapost.html}},
\textbf{PSTricks}\footnote{\url{http://tug.org/PSTricks/}},
\textbf{XY-Pic}\footnote{\url{http://www.tug.org/applications/Xy-pic/}},
\textbf{TikZ}\footnote{\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/}} or
\textbf{Sketch}\footnote{\url{http://www.frontiernet.net/~eugene.ressler/}}.
\textbf{draw.io}\footnote{\url{https://app.diagrams.net/}}

Save your pictures as \verb!.eps! files.  Texlive 2010 and later
versions will automatically convert these to pdf on compilation.  Note
that \verb!eps! supports both vector and bitmap formats, so simply
because it's an \verb!eps! doesn't mean it's vector.

\chapter{Results}

If you have lots of results tables, you can use the \textsf{datatool}
package~\cite{datatool} to import them automatically as the document
is compiled, saving you from having to convert them manually.

\Autoref{tab:example} demonstrates how you can mark up tables.  You
can apply most of this to figures---\emph{however, captions for
  figures must go at the bottom of the figure}.  Use the
\textsf{booktabs} package~\cite{booktabs} to ensure
professional-quality results!\footnote{See
  \url{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables\#Professional_tables}
  for an example of what a difference \textsf{booktabs} makes.}

\begin{table}
  \begin{center}
		\caption{Comparison of adaptivity features in common OSes (latest versions; including bundled applications)\label{tab:example}}
		\begin{tabular}{p{0.4\textwidth}ccc}
			\toprule
			Feature & Mac OS X & GNOME & Windows \\
			\midrule
			Sharing user's settings across machines & Yes & Yes & Yes \\
			Apply user's preferred settings automatically on log-in & Yes & Yes & Yes \\
			Suggesting appropriate assistive features to user & No & No & No \\
			Checking for appropriateness of enabled assistive features & No & No & No \\
			API for informing applications of users' needs & No & No & No \\
			API for applying adaptations to applications' content & No & No & No \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}

Thanks to the \textsf{hyperref} package, you can use the time-saving
\verb|\autoref| command instead of \verb|\ref| when referring to
figures, tables, sections and even theorems!  It puts in the type of
the thing you're citing (e.g.\ ``section~'') so that you don't have
to.  You can redefine the names of the elements referred to (such as
``section'') and, in fact, this can be used to make a version of
\verb|\autoref| that can be used at the beginning of sentences (to
ensure the first letter is capitalised).  Thanks to Ted
Pavlic,\footnote{\url{http://www.tedpavlic.com/post_preamble_for_journal_of_math_bio.php\#jmb_autoref_defs}}
we have been able to create several other commands you can use when
you need to refer to multiple items at once, or need the item type
name capitalised (i.e.\ at the beginning of a sentence); these
commands are \verb|\Autoref|, \verb|\Autorefs| and \verb|\autorefs|.

\textbf{Please note} that if you do use these commands, they will only
work if you are also using the \textsf{hyperref} package.  It is very
easy to make \textsf{hyperref} \emph{not} colour its output, so you
\emph{can} use it to print off your thesis for the external examiner
and for the final bound version---using hyperref does not force you to
have coloured text.

All you have to do to force hyperref to stop colouring text is pass
the \texttt{mono} option to \textsf{luthesis}!

Finally, you should note that the behaviour of the \verb|*utoref*|
commands has been altered ever so slightly so that they enforce no
non-breaking space before them.  This means that you can write
\verb|...as seen in \autoref{sec:results}| in the natural way you are
used to with \LaTeX.  The default behaviour would mean you have to
write \verb|...as seen in\autoref{sec:results}|, which seems unusual
and not what you would expect from a \verb|\ref|-style command.


\chapter{Conclusions\label{ch:conclusions}}

Here discuss your contributions and future work---and ensure you end
on a positive note!

Note that, in the \verb|.tex| file, the label is \emph{inside} the
\verb|\chapter{}| command.  This ensures that links to the chapter are
constructed properly.

Finally, to ensure that your ``References'' section is included in the
table of contents (if you are not using \textsf{gcite} or
\textsf{biblatex}), insert the following commands directly before the
\verb|\bibligoraphy{}| command.

\begin{verbatim}
\cleardoublepage
\phantomsection
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{References}
\end{verbatim}

Don't worry about the use of \verb|\cleardoublepage|---it does The
Right Thing(tm) when the document is single-sided.  Also, the
\verb|\phantomsection| is required if you are using \textbf{pdflatex}
and \textsf{hyperref}, as is \emph{strongly recommended} for
\textsf{luthesis} documents.

If you are using \textsf{gcite}---and therefore
\textsf{biblatex}---the procedure for adding the bibliography is
slightly different and you don't need to add the above commands.  This
is all explained in the \textsf{gcite} manual.


\chapter{Document Options}
The \verb!luthesis! class supports the following document options.
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|iwp| get the page numbering right, i.e. start at 1 and
  continue to the end with no special numbering for frontmatter.
\item \verb|cooetc| see below.
\item \verb|mono| guess!
\item \verb|twoside| double sided printing
\item \verb|openright| start all new chapters on a right hand page in two sided printing.
\end{itemize}

\section{Loughborough forms}

Loughborough require a \emph{Certificate of Originality, Thesis Access
  Conditions and Deposit Agreement} form to be bound as the first two
pages of the thesis.  This is available on the template shop as form
4.1c.  You can include this in your final PDF before printing by
following the following procedure:
\begin{itemize}
\item Download form 4.1c from the template shop, fill it in, print,
  sign and scan using an MFD.  Remember to scan as a multiple page
  job.
\item Take the emailed PDF and drop it into your thesis folder with
  the name \verb!CoOTACaDA.pdf!
\item Add the \verb!cooetc! option to your \verb!\documentclass!
  command.
\item rebuild.
\end{itemize}
If you wish (which I recommend) to change the file name from
CoOTACaDA.pdf, then use the \verb$\setcoofile{newfilename}$ command,
remembering to rename the file too.

\emph{There is a CoATACaDA.pdf file distributed with the luthesis
  zipfile.  This is not suitable for a submitted thesis, but allows
  compilation.  Remember to make one of your own}

\section{What type of report/thesis/dissertation?}
If you are completing an end-of-year report for a research degree,
then include word \verb$first$, \verb$second$ etc as an optino to your
\verb$\doicumentclass$ command.  This will adjust the first page as
necessary.

If you are preparing a transfer report, you should use this class with
the \verb$transfer$ option to your \verb$\documentclass$ command.

If you are preparing an M.Sc.\ dissertation, you should use this class
with the \verb$msc$ option.  You may also add your degree programme
title and id number using the following commands:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb$\programme$ The long name for your programme, e.g.\
  Internet Computing and Network Security.
\item \verb$\id$ Your id number.
\item \verb$\programmeshort$ A short version of your programme name,
  e.g.~ICNS.  This with your id number is printed in a box on the top
  right of the front page.
\end{itemize}

If you are preparing a final year project for an undergraduate degree
please use the \verb$fyp$ option (this also applies for the 3rd year
of a 4-year degree or 4th year of a 5-year degree).

There are other options provided by the class---please read the
documentation in the \texttt{.cls} file to learn about them (and the
changes from the standard document classes).

\bibliographystyle{plain}
\cleardoublepage
\phantomsection
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{References}
\bibliography{luthesis}

\backmatter
\appendix
\chapter{Example Appendix}

You should avoid using these but for supporting evidence that is not directly related to the main body of the thesis---e.g.\ to store large tables of results, where in the main text you only want to tell the story of and give the flavour of the results.  You may also like to include a list of your publications.
