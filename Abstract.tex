In October 2022, the UK hit an inflation rate of 11.1\%, the country's highest in over 40 years. 
Now more than ever, the ability to accurately predict inflation and other financial indicators is a crucial skill required by both the government and individuals in order to prepare themselves financially for the future. 
In a time where artificial intelligence and machine learning are ever flourishing, it is only natural to attempt to use these tools at our disposal to gain insight into the issues we face. 

This paper will attempt to produce several machine learning models capable of forecasting inflation and form a conclusion as to which of the models are most suitable for the task.
The results of this paper hope to serve as a reference for future researchers who wish to tackle the topic of inflation forecasting but are unsure of which machine learning methods to use.
