In October 2022, the UK hit an inflation rate of 11.1\%, the country's highest in over 40 years. 
Now more than ever, the ability to accurately predict inflation and other financial indicators is a crucial skill required by the government and the individual to prepare themselves for the future financially. 
In a time where Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are ever flourishing, 
it is only natural to attempt to use these tools at our disposal to predict and combat the issues we face. 
\par In this paper I will attempt to predict inflation through the use of machine learning eventually presenting my findings and evaluations.
